This is purely a prototype and the code is not the best in the world

Lejos 0.9 needs to run on the EV3

To run, connect the Android device to the EV3 via BT PAN, find out the IP (OS Monitor app can tell you this) and change it in the EV3 Lejos code

Run the Android app on the device first, then run the Lejos app.

Plug a motor in to port A in the Ev3

Tap the Android app, and it should speak, and the motor should move!
